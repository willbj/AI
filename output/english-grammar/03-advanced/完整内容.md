## 1. 虚拟语气实用场景

> **核心原则**：虚拟语气表达假设、愿望、建议，让表达更委婉、更礼貌。

### 1.1 与现在事实相反

**结构**：
- If 从句：`If + 主语 + 过去式`
- 主句：`主语 + would/could/might + 动词原形`

**例句**：

```
✅ 日常场景
If I had time, I would go to the gym.
（如果我有时间，我会去健身房。）
→ 实际：我没时间

If I were you, I would accept the offer.
（如果我是你，我会接受这个offer。）
→ 实际：我不是你

✅ 软件开发场景
If I had more resources, I would refactor the entire codebase.
（如果我有更多资源，我会重构整个代码库。）
→ 实际：资源不够

If this were production, we would be in trouble.
（如果这是生产环境，我们就麻烦了。）
→ 实际：不是生产环境
```

**注意**：虚拟语气中，be 动词统一用 `were`，不用 `was`。

---

### 1.2 与过去事实相反

**结构**：
- If 从句：`If + 主语 + had + 过去分词`
- 主句：`主语 + would/could/might + have + 过去分词`

**例句**：

```
✅ 日常场景
If I had known, I would have come earlier.
（如果我知道，我会早点来。）
→ 实际：我不知道，所以没早来

If she had studied harder, she would have passed the exam.
（如果她更努力学习，她会通过考试。）
→ 实际：她没努力，所以没通过

✅ 软件开发场景
If we had tested it properly, we wouldn't have had this bug.
（如果我们好好测试了，就不会有这个 bug。）
→ 实际：没好好测试，所以有 bug

If I had backed up the data, I wouldn't have lost everything.
（如果我备份了数据，就不会丢失所有东西。）
→ 实际：没备份，所以丢了
```

---

### 1.3 建议和要求（Should 虚拟）

**结构**：`建议/要求动词 + that + 主语 + (should) + 动词原形`

**常用动词**：suggest, recommend, propose, insist, demand, require

**例句**：

```
✅ 日常场景
I suggest that you (should) take a break.
（我建议你休息一下。）

The doctor recommended that he (should) quit smoking.
（医生建议他戒烟。）

（我希望我有更多时间。）
→ 实际：没有

I wish I could speak French.
（我希望我会说法语。）
→ 实际：不会

I wish I had studied harder.
（我希望我当时更努力学习。）
→ 实际：当时没努力

✅ 软件开发场景

（我希望我当时把文档写得更好。）

I wish we had more time to test.

```

## 2. 倒装句和强调句

> **核心原则**：倒装和强调让表达更有力，更符合英语习惯。

### 2.1 否定词开头的倒装

**常用否定词**：never, seldom, rarely, hardly, barely, not only, no sooner

### 2.3 强调句型

**结构**：`It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who + 其他`

**例句**：

```

强调主语：
It was I who met her in Beijing last year.
（是我去年在北京遇见她的。）

强调地点：
It was in Beijing that I met her last year.
（是在北京我去年遇见她的。）

强调时间：
It was last year that I met her in Beijing.
（是去年我在北京遇见她的。）

```
直接（不礼貌）：
"Your code is wrong. This will cause a bug."

委婉（礼貌）：
"I see what you're trying to do here. However, I'm concerned that this might cause an issue when the input is null. What do you think about adding a validation check?"

（我明白你想做什么。但是，我担心当输入为 null 时这可能会导致问题。你觉得加个验证检查怎么样？）
```

---

### 6.2 礼貌地提出请求

| 直接表达 | 礼貌表达 |
|----------|----------|
| ❌ Review my code. | ✅ Could you review my code when you have time? |
| ❌ Fix this bug. | ✅ Would you mind taking a look at this bug? |
| ❌ Help me. | ✅ I was wondering if you could help me with this. |

B: I'd love to help, but I'm currently working on a critical bug fix. Could we revisit this next week?
（我很想帮忙，但我目前在处理一个关键 bug。我们下周再讨论这个可以吗？）

A: Let's deploy on Friday afternoon.

```

---

### 6.4 表达不确定性

| 确定表达 | 不确定表达 |
|----------|------------|
| This is the solution. | This might be a solution. |
| It will work. | It should work. / It might work. |
| I know. | I think. / I believe. |
| It's a bug. | It seems like a bug. / It appears to be a bug. |

**用途**：避免过于武断，给自己留余地。

**实用对话**：
```
过于确定（不好）：
"This is definitely the cause of the bug."

适当不确定（更好）：
"Based on the logs, it seems like this might be causing the issue. Let me investigate further to confirm."

（根据日志，这似乎可能是导致问题的原因。让我进一步调查确认一下。）
