## 1. 完成时态详解

> **核心原则**：完成时是非母语者最难掌握的时态，但掌握后表达会更地道。

### 1.1 现在完成时（Present Perfect）

**用途**：过去发生的事对现在有影响

**结构**：`主语 + have/has + 过去分词`

**关键理解**：
- ✅ 强调"已经完成"或"经历过"
- ✅ 不能和具体过去时间连用（yesterday, last week 等）

**例句**：

```
✅ 日常场景
I have finished my work.
（我已经完成工作了。）→ 现在可以休息了

She has been to Japan.
（她去过日本。）→ 有这个经历

They have lived here for 5 years.
（他们在这里住了 5 年。）→ 现在还住这里

✅ 软件开发场景
I have fixed the bug.
（我已经修复了这个 bug。）→ 现在可以测试了

We have deployed the new version.
（我们已经部署了新版本。）→ 现在线上是新版本

The test has passed.
（测试已经通过了。）→ 现在状态是通过的
```

---

### 1.2 现在完成时 vs 一般过去时

**关键区别**：

| 时态 | 强调 | 时间标志 | 例句 |
|------|------|----------|------|
| **现在完成时** | 对现在的影响 | already, yet, just, ever, never | I **have finished** the work. |
| **一般过去时** | 过去的事实 | yesterday, last week, ago | I **finished** the work yesterday. |

**对比例句**：

```
✅ 现在完成时（强调结果）
I have read this book.
（我读过这本书。）→ 我知道内容了

✅ 一般过去时（强调过去）
I read this book last month.
（我上个月读了这本书。）→ 陈述过去的事

---

✅ 现在完成时
Have you eaten lunch?
（你吃午饭了吗？）→ 关心现在饿不饿

✅ 一般过去时
Did you eat lunch at 12?
（你 12 点吃午饭了吗？）→ 询问过去的事实

---

✅ 软件开发场景
I have pushed the code.
（我已经推送代码了。）→ 现在可以拉取了

I pushed the code 10 minutes ago.
（我 10 分钟前推送了代码。）→ 陈述过去的时间点
```

**易错点**：
```
❌ I have finished it yesterday.
✅ I finished it yesterday.
（有具体时间用过去时）

❌ Did you ever been to Beijing?
✅ Have you ever been to Beijing?
（经历用现在完成时）
```

---

### 1.3 现在完成进行时（Present Perfect Continuous）

**用途**：从过去开始一直持续到现在的动作

**结构**：`主语 + have/has been + 动词-ing`

**例句**：

```
✅ 日常场景
I have been working here for 3 years.
（我在这里工作 3 年了。）→ 还在继续

She has been learning English since 2020.
（她从 2020 年开始学英语。）→ 还在学

✅ 软件开发场景
I have been debugging this issue all morning.
（我整个上午都在调试这个问题。）→ 还在调试

The server has been running for 30 days.
（服务器已经运行 30 天了。）→ 还在运行
```
